# zig-waybar-contrib
A collection of high-performance Waybar modules written in Zig, designed specifically for Arch Linux systems.

## Overview
`zig-waybar-contrib` provides efficient, lightweight modules for [Waybar](https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar) by leveraging the performance and safety features of [Zig](https://ziglang.org/). These modules are optimized and focus on system monitoring and status reporting.

## Features
- **High Performance**: Optimized implementation in Zig for minimal resource usage
- **Modular Design**: Use only the modules you need
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Accurate system metrics with minimal overhead

## Available Modules
- All modules write a single line json output.
- All modules are compiled with LTO and ReleaseFast optimizations. See the [build](./build.zig) file for details.

### Updates Module
Tracks available system updates on Arch Linux
- Status: ‚úÖ Implemented
- Dependencies: `pacman-contrib`, `fakeroot`
- Note: Compatible only with Arch-based distributions

### GPU Module
Monitors GPU statistics and performance
- Status: ‚úÖ Implemented | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partially Working
- Known Issues: Path resolution errors may affect functionality
- Supports: AMD GPUs (RX series)

### Memory Module
Tracks system memory usage and statistics
- Status: ‚úÖ Implemented
- Features: Real-time memory monitoring
- Displays: Used/Total memory, usage percentage

### Ping Module
Network latency monitoring
- Status: ‚úÖ Implemented
- Features: Configurable ping targets
- Displays: Current network latency

### CPU Module
CPU usage and temperature monitoring
- Status: üöß In Development
- Planned Features: Usage percentage, temperature, frequency

## Installation
- Download the latest release from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/erffy/zig-waybar-contrib/releases)

## Configuration

Add modules to your Waybar configuration (`~/.config/waybar/config`):

```json
{
    "modules-right": [
        "custom/updates",
        "custom/gpu",
        "custom/memory",
        "custom/ping"
    ],
    "custom/updates": {
        "exec": "path/to/updates-module",
        "return-type": "json",
        "interval": 3600
    }
    // Add other module configurations as needed
}
```
